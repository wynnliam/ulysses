/*
	The Atmosphere is responsible for a Planet's
	temperature data. The temperature data is represented
	in the form of the Temperature Map - which is the
	temperatures of every land point. The Temperature map
	is a combination of several submaps as follows:

	Altitude - The height of each point.
	Latitude - The distance each point is from a specified
	equator.
	Wind - Essentially a smooth noise map that represents wind
	patterns and their effects on the temperature.
	Distance to sea - TODO: Finish me!
