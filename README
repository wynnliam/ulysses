Liam Wynn, 12/21/2017, Ulysses

Ulysses will be a long term experiment in world building.
This could be a game in the future. For now, it will be
a glorified walking simulator. The features I add to it
are distilled from A Clash of Colors.

ACOC will still exist spirtually from Ulysses. It's that
ACOC was so feature-bloated that I had to kill it. Instead,
I plan on adding features and developing it overtime.

My goal is to have all the features implemented relatively
quickly. Further, I'd like to make sure everything is
well-designed and maintained.

Addendum 12/21/2017 - Basic World Generation

The first thing I plan on developing is a very simplistic
terrain generator that is loosely based on plate tectonics
and orogeny.

Briefly, plate tectonics is a theory that the world is carved
up into a series of giant slabs that move and collide. These
collisions result in the mountains, volcanoes, continents, etc.

More specifically, it's not the "world" as a whole, but the outter
most layer, which is apart of the Lithosphere. We say that this
thin layer is "crust".

There are two types of crust: oceanic and continental. As the names
would imply, oceanic crust is under the oceans, and continental is
above it. All land-based life lives on continental crust.

Actually, technically speaking, some continental crust is underwater.
What differentiates continental crust from oceanic is generally its
chemical composition. Further, generally speaking, continental crust
is older and thicker than oceanic crust (among other things). In fact,
the youngest continental crust is roughly 25 million years older than
oceanic crust.

We use these properties to make our crust. It is very much a far-cry
from the actual science, but it is still loosely related. In essence,
we generate an age map and a thickness map to determine what is land
and ocean.
